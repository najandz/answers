<h1>Object Oriented JavaScript</h1>
<p>Create an object model for a zoo in pure JavaScript. Use the principles of <i>Object Oriented programming</i> and <u>inheritence</u> to describe the various animals and where they live.</p>
<p>Note: Try to use inheritence in your demo. Eg: Start with an Animal class, and subclass to create the classes for each animal type.</p>
<p>When you are done, the following lines of code should produce the corresponding output below:</p>

<pre>

    zoo.pokeAnimals();

    // Lion says "Roar!", Goat says "Baaa!", Cat says "Meow", Horse says "Nee!"
